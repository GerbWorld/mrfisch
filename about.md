# Mr. Fisch - Confessions of an Illustrated Educator

Welcome to Mr. Fisch's new website!  Apologies for the dust,
cleaning up after last year's classes caused quite a mess.

## Thanks

Mr. Fisch is dedicated with love, hope, and frustration to the roughly 600+ students I have taught.

Also to my wife and parents for making things possible.

Also to people who support and respect teachers, and realize good schools make for a good country.
