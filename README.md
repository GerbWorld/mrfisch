## How it works

This is a Github Pages hosted website.  The author creates _post files using
Markdown, a simple formatting language, with a corresponding
comic strip in the /strips directory.  The Markdown file simply points
to the comic strip file, and includes a short caption or other text
that you want to appear next to it.  Then push the changes to
github, and it magically all works!
