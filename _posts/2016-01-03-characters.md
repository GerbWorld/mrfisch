excerpt: Our cast of Characters

Mr. Fisch is the teacher, and he has a whole bunch of students!

This could be one page, or multiple pages.  I can help setup a basic
way for you to add "tables" within this page, each one would
have the character picture, their name (in bold as a title or
something) and then a short description of the character.
